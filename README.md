# PHP_With_Forms_Assessment


In this programming assignment you will be practicing how to build forms and use PHP to get information from them.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository with 4 PHP files inside.

<ul>To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

<li>Write an 2 PHP files that each have a standard HTML form with at least 5 different inputs</li>
 <li>One form should make a $_GET request that redirects to another PHP page and prints the information inside of HTML tags</li>
<li>The other form should make a $_POST request that redirects to another PHP page and prints the information inside of HTML tags</li>
<li>This means 4 total PHP pages, 2 for the forms and 2 for the redirects</li>
</ul?
<br>
<ul>
<li>Be creative with the forms and use whatever kind of values you like, but make each form different (don't copy and paste your first form and change to POST, that's boring).</li>
</li>Make sure each input has a corresponding label and that the label and input combo have the right attributes to make them work per the module videos. </li>
<li>Be sure to protect your use of $_GET and $_POST so that a nefarious instructor doesn't dock you points for being able to break your website.</li?
</ul>
