# PHP_With_Forms_Assessment


In this programming assignment you will be practicing how to build forms and use PHP to get information from them.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository with 4 PHP files inside.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Write an 2 PHP files that each have a standard HTML form with at least 5 different inputs
One form should make a $_GET request that redirects to another PHP page and prints the information inside of HTML tags
The other form should make a $_POST request that redirects to another PHP page and prints the information inside of HTML tags
This means 4 total PHP pages, 2 for the forms and 2 for the redirects
Be creative with the forms and use whatever kind of values you like, but make each form different (don't copy and paste your first form and change to POST, that's boring).
Make sure each input has a corresponding label and that the label and input combo have the right attributes to make them work per the module videos. 
Be sure to protect your use of $_GET and $_POST so that a nefarious instructor doesn't dock you points for being able to break your website.
